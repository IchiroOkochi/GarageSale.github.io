# Prodigy Garage Sale Website

This repository contains a simple, responsive website template for showcasing items in a garage sale. The project uses plain HTML and CSS so you can edit it quickly without any build tools.

## Files
- `index.html` – main page with sample items
- `style.css` – styling for layout and responsiveness

## Customizing
1. Add new items by copying the `<article class="item">` block in `index.html` and updating the image, title, and description.
2. Store your photos in the `images` folder and update the `<img>` tags in `index.html` to point to them.
3. Adjust colors and fonts in `style.css` to match your desired look.

That's it! Open `index.html` in a browser to view the current page.
